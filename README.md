CDSR / Wikipedia
================

Scripts to help cross-reference the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Wikipedia.

Dependencies
------------

You need a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with npm (the installer for Windows has NPM included). The scripts were verified to work with v6.9.2 (`node --version`).

Then, you will need to install the required packages using the command:

```
npm install
```

Getting PubMed IDs for Cochrane reviews
---------------------------------------

You need a UTF-8 CSV file named 'reviews-not-withdrawn.csv', containing columns named "Review DOI" and "Title". Such a file can be generated by export from Archie based on the following search:

```
Documents search, Match all rows (AND)
Document Type | Is | Review Document
Publication Status | Is | Published
Review Status | Is not | Withdrawn
Version Stage | Is | Full Review
```

Then, run the following command:

```
node cdsrPmid
```

This will generate a file named `reviews-not-withdraw-pmid.csv`.

Finding DOIs of cited Cochrane Reviews on Wikipedia
---------------------------------------------------

Run the following command:

```
node wikipediaDoi
```
