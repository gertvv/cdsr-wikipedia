CDSR / Wikipedia
================

Scripts to help cross-reference the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Wikipedia.

Dependencies
------------

You need a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with npm (the installer for Windows has NPM included). The scripts were verified to work with v6.9.2 (`node --version`).

Then, you will need to install the required packages using the command:

```
npm install
```

Getting PubMed IDs for Cochrane reviews
---------------------------------------

Run

```
node queryPubMed
```

This will generate a file `doi-pmid.csv`.

Listing active Cochrane reviews
-------------------------------

You need a UTF-8 CSV file named `published-reviews.csv`, containing columns named "Review DOI", "Title", and "Group Name". Such a file can be generated by export from Archie based on the following search:

```
Documents search, Match all rows (AND)
Document Type | Is | Review Document
Publication Status | Is | Published
Review Status | Is | Active
Version Stage | Is | Full Review
```

By default Archie generates UTF-8 with BOM, which needs to be re-saved without BOM. Export to Excel and saving to CSV from Excel appears to be move performant/reliable, but also produced UTF-8 with BOM.

The review document API unfortunately does not return the full DOI, otherwise it would be a good replacement for this manual step.

Finding DOIs of cited Cochrane Reviews on Wikipedia
---------------------------------------------------

Run

```
node wikipediaDoi en
```

This will generate a file `wikipedia-dois-en.csv`.

Cross-referencing the files
---------------------------

Run

```
node crossReference en
```
